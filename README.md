# ADM Homework 2

This repository contains our submission for Homework 2 of the Applied Data Mining (ADM) course at Sapienza University of Rome. The assignment involves analyzing a dataset of video game reviews from Steam. Tasks include performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), exploring review distribution across games, analyzing review patterns over time, investigating user behavior, calculating probabilities, and performing sentiment analysis on review texts. Additionally, a bonus algorithmic problem tests your ability to represent numbers as sums of integers of the same parity. Each step encourages documentation of methods and findings.
